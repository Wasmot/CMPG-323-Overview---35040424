The GitHub flow branching strategy is a relatively simple workflow that allows smaller teams, or web applications/products that don’t require supporting multiple versions, to expedite their work.

In GitHub flow, the main branch contains your production-ready code.

The other branches, feature branches, should contain work on new features and bug fixes and will be merged back into the main branch when the work is finished and properly reviewed. This strategy will be used in all projects.

For each project, the .gitignore file tells git which files it should ignore when it commits the project to a GitHub repository.

Passwords and sensitive information should not be stored in code or on GitHub as people who have access to your repository will have access to this information as well.
